## Applications of Hidden Markov Models in Earthquake Prediction

* Identified seismicity patterns to evaluate earthquake risk in earthquake-prone areas
* Determined the best Hidden Markov Models for predicting earthquakes by global decoding (Viterbi Algorithm)
* Compared models with different hidden states by model selection and residual diagnostics
* Interpreted the meaning behind different hidden states and explored possible applications of the model
* Predicted the years with high-frequency earthquakes
